            <h2 class="title">THE HIGH PRIEST<br>
            </h2>
            <p>If you could demonstrate something to me, anything,<br>
               of our late capital reality, ’twould at least be comforting.<br>
               It would assume operating prosthetics has a function,<br>
               that firmness and finesse are consecrated marrow too.</p>
            <p>Or if, say, you could tell me more about the dummy— <br>
               its floral bodice and littoral sections, its waving airs<br>
               much like actual sculpted waves, of what things are<br>
               supposed to be once living, if anything’s really living.</p>
            <p>Either way, I grow tired in a rowing isthmus, fruited<br>
               with what abandonments the sky performs for itself. <br>
               I’ve suffered, too. Pierced as this diamonded droplet<br>
               held in front of you, set into the meat of your hands.</p>

            <h2 class="title">BOULEVARD RASPAIL</h2>
              <blockquote>I WOULD TELL YOU THAT I DON’T KNOW. <br>
              –GIORGIO DE CHIRICO</blockquote>
            <p>Today too is an impostor. The cut fruit,<br>
              The garbled scented meat, the poured egg,</p>
            <p>The steamed milk, the fresh coal, lazy silks<br>
              Of corded rose—we’ve seen these before.</p>
            <p>They appear then emerge quite naturally. <br>
              So, taking delight, one is taken by delight.</p>
            <p>Drifting over corrugated space, wondering<br>
              Nerves become exposed, eroded and raw.</p>
            <p>Fragrant lips of the minute sour closed. <br>
              Drops of peppermint drip onto wrists.</p>
            <p>Anonymous weeping seeps into bone. <br>
              Shading windows, adrift over andirons,</p>
            <p>Metal light dangles like a foreign lozenge. <br>
              Night cools, pools open, comes and goes.</p>
            <p>My life has led to this. Searching in sleep, <br>
              Arriving at a corridor, not bankrupt, just alone.</p><br>
