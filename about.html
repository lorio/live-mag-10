          <h2>About Live Mag!</h2>
          <p>Live Mag! was born to run at the Bowery Poetry Club. Bob Holman and Jeff Wright conceived it as a performance / publication dual event created specifically for the Bowery Poetry Club.</p> <p>The live events began with featured editors of other publications as guests. These guests read their own works, read some favorites and then solicited poems from the audience to read. The readings are published here, in print, and in performance. It has evolved as a spirited venue for poets, artists and lovers of poetry and art.</p>
<p>Editor guests included Hannah Winarsky, editor of Princeton University Press, William Electric Black of La Mama Etc., Michael Andre of Unmuzzled Ox, Erika Jo Brown, editor of Stretching Panties Magazine, Bob Holman of the Bowery Poetry Press and Gary Parrish of Farfalla Press.</p>

After moving to New York City in 1976 he studied with Ted Berrigan and Alice Notley at St. Mark's Church. He began Hard Press and published poetry postcards and books.</p>
<p>In 1987 he went to study with Allen Ginsberg at Brooklyn College. Wright earned his Masters in Fine Arts in Poetry there. Ginsberg wrote a forward to his book, <em>Take Over</em>. Wright published <em>Cover Magazine</em> for fifteen years until 2000.</p>
